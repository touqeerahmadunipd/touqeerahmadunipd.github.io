I am a DSTrain – MSCA (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions) Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo, Norway. My current research focuses on stochastic modeling of natural processes.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institut Denis Poisson, University of Orléans, France (May–October 2025), where I worked on handling missing data in high-dimensional environmental datasets. Before that, I held a postdoctoral position at ENSAI, France, focusing on dimension reduction and imbalanced data classification.

I earned my PhD in Statistical Sciences, with a Doctor Europaeus title, from the University of Padova, Italy. My doctoral research focused on "On the modeling of discrete extreme values".


**Research Interest**

My work lies at the intersection of stochastic processes, statistical modeling, and machine learning.
I am particularly interested in:

- Modeling and analysis of spatiotemporal dependence in extreme events
- Stochastic modeling of complex natural and environmental systems
- Statistical learning methods for high-dimensional, imbalanced, or incomplete datasets
- Applications of dimension reduction and data-driven approaches in environmental and climate research
