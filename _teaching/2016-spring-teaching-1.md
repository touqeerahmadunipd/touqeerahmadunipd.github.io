### 2. Regression Analysis (45 hours – Autumn Semester 2016)

This course focused on correlation, causality, and regression modeling.  
**Key topics included:**
- Simple and multiple linear regression  
- Model assumptions: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality  
- Least squares estimation and goodness-of-fit measures (R², adjusted R²)  
- Hypothesis testing with t-tests and F-tests  
- Multicollinearity and residual analysis  
- Logistic and nonlinear regression  

**Tutorials and Workshops:**  
Students practiced model fitting, diagnostics, and interpretation in **R**.

Introduced the importance of nonparametric techniques when parametric assumptions are violated.  
**Topics covered:**
- Distribution-free and rank-based methods  
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann–Whitney U test, Kruskal–Wallis test  
- Goodness-of-fit tests: Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Anderson–Darling test  
- Robust alternatives to traditional parametric approaches  

**Tutorials and Workshops:**  
Hands-on sessions analyzing real datasets using nonparametric methods in **R**.
